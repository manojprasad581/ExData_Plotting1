## Purpose
 - This is the assignment for the Week1 of the Course "Exploratory Data Analysis"
 - The purpose is to put into practise the techniques learnt under Base Plotting  

## Layout of this repository
 - This repository contains below files
    - README (this file)
    - Below scripts to generate the required plots
        - plot1.R to generate plot1.png
        - plot2.R to generate plot2.png
        - plot3.R to generate plot3.png
        - plot4.R to generate plot4.png
    - Below png files generated by the above scripts
        - plot1.png generated plot1.R
        - plot2.png generated plot2.R
        - plot3.png generated plot3.R
        - plot4.png generated plot4.R
    - Directory named "figure" which is inherited from the parent repository forked
        - No changes were made to this directory contents 
        - This should  merely be used as a reference

## Scripts Execution
 - Please download the Input DataSet file "household_power_consumption.txt" into this directory
    - The current directory where README.md exists
    - Note: Since "household_power_consumption.txt" is huge, this file couldn't be added to this repository
 - Please set the working directory to the current directory (where README.md exists)
 - Scripts should execute successfully if the working directory is set as mentioned above and "household_power_consumption.txt" exists in the current directory
 - The output plots would be dumped under this same directory
